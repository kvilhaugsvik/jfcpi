FreecivRecorder
 * Have the player check what the server returns
 * Don't do a proper get hack file creation if it failed in the trace
 * Merge all connections in one file
 * Make more of the filtering accessible from the command line

GeneratePackets
 * Continue making code generation more typed
 * Mark named basic data types without using Field
   - as the boxed numbers can't be extended in Java the alternatives are annotation or wrapper class

JavaGenerator
 * Support rewrite formatting
 * Support formatting -5 as -5 without turning 2 - 5 in to 2 -5
 * Review or rewrite the default code style

Documentation:
 * Add support for Javadoc and Scaladoc to the build system
 * Add Javadoc and Scaladoc to the undocumented source files

Generally
 * Make the code more consistent by finishing or removing incomplete abstractions
 * Fix misleading names
 * Improve speed (consider: nio, inlining generated code, compression, etc)

Portability
 * I probably won't do this myself. Check that WantHackProtocol work on various versions and configurations of Windows.
   Fix issues in a way that won't break other platforms. (So if some special Windows only method is required use it via
   reflection)
