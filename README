 * Start the Freeciv server. You can do this using the command
     FREECIV_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=0 ./fcser -p 55555
   in the folder where you have compiled Freeciv.
 * Load a saved game the record should be on top of. It may be right after game start or later.
     /load alienStart
   on the Freeciv server command line should load a saved game called alienStart.
   Setting gameseed and mapseed in stead of using a saved game won't work at the moment.

     ./proxyRecorder

 * Connect a client to the port the proxy is listening to.
     ./fcgui -a
   in the folder where you have compiled Freeciv.
