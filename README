For information on how to build everything see INSTALL

At the moment the main thing this system does is to record and play back a Freeciv game. This README will therefore
focus on recording.

Recording a game can be done for many reasons. Being able to observe a game you played after it is over may help you
become a better player. Showing off your skills may be fun. Demonstrating a strategy for beginners and AI's that learn
by watching may also be interesting. It may also have potential as a real paranoid debugging tool. As you are reading
this I assume you already have your own motivation for recording a game.

========================================================================================================================
Quick start
========================================================================================================================

Record a game
 * Start the Freeciv server. You can do this using the command
     FREECIV_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=0 ./fcser -p 55555
   in the folder where you have compiled Freeciv.
 * Load a saved game the record should be on top of. It may be right after game start or later.
     /load alienStart
   on the Freeciv server command line should load a saved game called alienStart.
   Alternatively you may set the gameseed AND the mapseed via the recorded client.
 * Start the recorder. The line below use the default trace name and will overwrite previous traces.
     ./proxyRecorder
   in this folder should do it. As the play back don't use server packets you can reduce the size of the trace using
     ./proxyRecorder --trace-exclude-from-server
 * Connect a client to the port the proxy is listening to.
     ./fcgui -a
   in the folder where you have compiled Freeciv.

Play it back:
 * Start the Freeciv server:
     FREECIV_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=0 ./fcser
   in the folder where you have compiled Freeciv
  * Unless the setting of mapseed and gameseed was recorded load the save game the record should be on top of. It may be right after game start or later.
     /load alienStart
   on the Freeciv server command line should load a saved game called alienStart.
 * Start the play back
     ./playRecord 
   in this folder should start playing a record that has the default file name.
 * Connect to the server using a different login name than when you played. In the connection dialog click observe.
     ./fcgui
   in the folder where you have compiled Freeciv

Details
========================================================================================================================
The way proxyRecorder works is that it pretends to be the Freeciv server when it talk to the client and pretend to be
the Freeciv client when talking to the server. Before forwarding what is said to who it really was meant for it can
record it to a file. This kind of file is called a trace. The trace can later be played by a player that pretends to be
a Freeciv client and play back what was recorded. As some things aren't sent between the client and the server you have
to make sure that the server is in the same state it was when the trace was recorded to play it back.

If Freeciv have changed it may not be possible to ensure that the state is the same. Rules may be different, the built in AI may react to to player actions in a
new way and the "dice" of the game may start to give different numbers. If the version is the same there are two ways to make sure the state is the same.
One is to load the same saved game before the recording as before the play back. The other way is to set Freecivs random seeds to the same values. If
this is done from the client after the recording have began it should be recorded like all other actions.

--- proxyRecorder ---
The quick start showed the trace-exclude-from-server option of proxyRecorder. There are more options. To change an
option write --optionName=newValue (note: no space) where optionName is the option and newValue is the new value.

You can change where proxyRecorder will expect to find the Freeciv client or the Freeciv server.
 --proxy-port - the port where the recorder will let Freeciv clients connect. The default is a port the Freeciv client
                will try without having to be told to try it.
 --real-server-port - connect to the real Freeciv server on this port. The default is 55555. Pass the option -p 55555
                      to the real Freeciv server when you start it to make it listen to this port.
 --real-server-address - the machine the real Freeciv server is on. The default is the machine you now use.

Normally the trace for the first connection is then FreecivCon0.fct, the second FreecivCon1.fct, etc.
 --trace-name-start - The start of the file name of the traces. The default is FreecivCon.
 --trace-name-end - The end of the file name of the traces. The default is .fct.

Time can be included in the trace. This makes it possible to record when something happen. It also makes it possible to
record games that has a time out. Note that the time takes a lot of extra space.
 --record-time - is set to true by default. To turn it off use the option --record-time=false

Not everything is needed to play back a trace. playRecord only use packets sent from the client that aren't connection
packets. These take a lot less space than a full trace.
 --trace-exclude-connection - don't record connection packets in the trace. This is on by default.
 --trace-exclude-from-server - don't record packets sent by the server in the trace. This is off by default.
 --trace-exclude-from-client - don't record packets sent by the client in the trace. The client send few packets
                               compared to the server so this won't save much space. It will also make the record
                               unusable in playRecord. Its value in other areas, like AI training data, also decreases.
                               This is off by default.

This file may be out of date.
 --help - will show the options, their default values and a short description and then exit

Developers may find the following options interesting
 --verbose - be verbose on the console
 --understand - interpret the packets before processing them. Warn if not understood. Can be used with trace-to-console
                to get a text trace on the console.
 --debug - print debug information to the console
 --trace-to-console - print all packets going to the trace to the console

--- playRecord ---
The options of playRecord are
 --file - the file containing the trace to play back. Defaults to FreecivCon0.fct. To play many files separate them
          using a colon like this
            ./playRecord --file=FreecivCon0.fct:FreecivCon1.fct

 --address - where the Freeciv server is. Defaults to your computer
 --port - the port to connect to to find the Freeciv sever

 --ignore-time - ignore time data in the trace. Wait a bit between each action in stead.

 --help - will show the options, their default values and a short description and then exit
