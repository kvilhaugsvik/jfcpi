At the moment there are no proper installation support. Running it from this directory should work.

What you'll need
 * A Java 7 (Java 6 hasn't been tested for a while) JDK. A JRE is not enough.
 * JUnit 4.10 (other versions not tested)
 * GNU Make 3.81 (other versions are probably OK)
 * The Freeciv trunk source code (SVN revision 22783 is known to work)
 * Scala 2.9 (2.10 is not tested yet)

Building
The Makefile in this folder don't have a ./configure script. It therefore may need to be told where it can find its
dependencies. If you are running Debian Wheezy and installed all the dependencies from the official Debian repository
and have placed this folder in Freeciv trunk the defaults should be OK. If not you must override the default values from
the command line. You override them by setting them before the command. The information that is needed is:
 * JAVA - the java application launcher
 * JAVAC - the java compiler
 * JAR - the jar utility
 * SCALA - the scala application launcher
 * SCALAC - the scala compiler
 * SCALALIB - the scala library
 * JUNIT - the JUnit library
To compile using a JUnit located in ~/lib to run the tests and a jar from ~/bin/jar use the command
  JUNIT=~/lib/junit.jar JAR=~/bin/jar make all

Freeciv has its own documentation on how to build it and what you need. You won't have to install it to test recording.
It is worth having a look at. If all of Freeciv's build dependencies are there entering its folder and running
,/autogen.sh && make
should work.

When this is done see README for instructions on how to record and play back a Freeciv game.
